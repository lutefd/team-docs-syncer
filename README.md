Collaborate on Markdown notes with your team using **your own Git repository** as the sync backend ‚Äî no paid sync services required.  
This Obsidian plugin adds lightweight collaboration features on top of Git, including:

- Edit reservations
- Automatic commits
- Conflict helpers
- An AI-powered document assistant
- An activity feed

It‚Äôs **free**, **auditable**, and works well for small to mid-sized teams comfortable with Git.

---

## Key Features

- **Git-based sync** ‚Äî Works with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted Git.
- **Edit reservations** ‚Äî Prevents accidental overwrites by letting a user ‚Äúreserve‚Äù a file for a limited time.
- **Auto-commit on change** ‚Äî Automatically stages and commits edits after a short idle period.
- **AI-powered document assistant** ‚Äî Search, summarize, and brief your team docs like a self-updating NotebookLM, powered by multiple AI providers.
- **Smart file operations** ‚Äî AI can propose edits, create new files, and help with content generation.
- **Activity feed** ‚Äî See recent team activity and reservation events.
- **Status indicator** ‚Äî Live sync/conflict/error status in Obsidian‚Äôs status bar.
- **Conflict helpers** ‚Äî Guided resolution for merge conflicts and local changes.
- **Responsive design** ‚Äî Modern UI that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Configurable** ‚Äî Choose your team docs folder, remote URL, AI providers, and more.

---

## How It Works

- Your vault contains a subfolder (e.g., `Team/Docs`) as the shared **Team Docs root**.
- The plugin runs Git commands in that folder: fetch, pull, push, add, commit.
- Edit reservations are recorded via empty Git commits (e.g., `[RESERVE] path - user - timestamp`).
- On save/idle, the plugin auto-commits your changes and triggers a sync.
- If someone else has reserved a file, you‚Äôll be warned before editing.
- The AI assistant can search, read, and summarize your team docs using various AI providers.

---

## Requirements

- **Obsidian Desktop** (Git CLI required ‚Äî mobile support is limited).
- **Git installed** and available in your system PATH.
- **Writable Git remote** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted).
- **Optional**: API keys for AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local Ollama).

---

## Configuration

Open the plugin‚Äôs settings tab in Obsidian:

### Git Settings

- **Team Docs Folder** ‚Äî Path inside your vault for shared docs (e.g., `Team/Docs`).
- **Git Remote URL** ‚Äî Your repository‚Äôs URL.
- **User Name / Email** ‚Äî Used for Git commits and reservations.
- **Auto Sync on Startup** ‚Äî Sync automatically when Obsidian launches.
- **Auto Sync Interval (min)** ‚Äî Periodic sync interval (0 to disable).
- **Attachments Subdirectory** ‚Äî Where pasted images are stored (e.g., `assets`).

### AI Provider Settings

- **OpenAI** ‚Äî API key for GPT models (latest GPT‚Äë5, GPT‚Äë4o, GPT‚Äë4o-mini, etc.).
- **Anthropic** ‚Äî API key for Claude models (Claude 4 Sonnet, Haiku, Opus).
- **Google** ‚Äî API key for Gemini models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, etc.).
- **Ollama** ‚Äî Base URL and model list for local AI models.
- **Advanced Settings** ‚Äî Temperature, max tokens, and other parameters.

---

## Typical Workflow

### File Collaboration

1. Open a file under the Team Docs folder.
2. Start editing ‚Äî the plugin will reserve the file for you.
3. Reservation auto-extends while you edit.
4. After idle, changes are auto-committed.
5. Use the Status Indicator to sync, check updates, or open the activity feed.

### AI-Assisted Document Work

- Open the **Chatbot View** from the ribbon or command palette.
- Select your AI provider and model.
- Ask questions, request summaries, or get document briefings.
- Use `@filename` to reference specific files.
- Switch between **Chat Mode** (fluid exploration) and **Write Mode** (targeted editing) depending on your task.

---

## AI Features

Both modes share the same AI tools through the **composer**, but differ in focus:

### Chat Mode ‚Äî Fluid Exploration

- Search and read relevant files to answer questions.
- Summarize and brief entire sections of your docs.
- Automatically follow links between notes to uncover related context you might not know exists.
- Traverse your directory structure to find deeper connections.
- Automatic source citations with clickable links.
- Pin files to focus AI attention.

### Write Mode ‚Äî Targeted Editing

- Choose specific files to edit, reducing token usage and speeding up processing.
- Request content creation or modifications for selected files.
- AI proposes complete file edits with an interactive diff review.
- Create new files with AI-generated content.
- Edit proposals before applying changes.

### Supported AI Providers

- **OpenAI** ‚Äî Every text based model.
- **Anthropic** ‚Äî Every text based model.
- **Google** ‚Äî Every text based model.
- **Ollama** ‚Äî Local models like Llama, Gemma, and custom fine-tunes.

---

## Handling Conflicts

- Local changes that would be overwritten trigger a modal:
  - **Commit & Sync**
  - **Stash & Sync**
  - **Discard & Sync**
- Merge conflicts open a resolution modal with strategy options.
- AI-proposed changes are always reviewed via an interactive diff.

---

## Limitations

- Not real-time ‚Äî sync is Git-based and periodic.
- Edit reservations are cooperative, not enforced.
- Desktop only (mobile limited by Git CLI).
- Large binary files or huge repos may slow performance.
- AI features require internet and valid API keys (except Ollama).

---

## Security & Privacy

- Your notes stay in **your repository** ‚Äî no third-party servers beyond your Git host.
- AI providers process content per their privacy policies.
- Ollama runs locally and keeps all data on your machine.
- Avoid committing secrets ‚Äî use `.gitignore`.
- AI chat history is stored locally.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Git is installed and in PATH.
- Verify remote URL and credentials.
- Check AI provider API keys and connectivity.
- For Ollama, ensure the service is running and models are available.
- Check the console for Git or AI errors.

## FAQ

**Why Git instead of real-time sync?**  
Git is free, ubiquitous, and works offline. This plugin makes it practical for teams already using Git.

**Can two users edit the same file?**  
Yes, but the reservation system reduces conflicts. Conflicts can still happen and must be resolved.

**Does this replace paid sync services?**  
For many teams, yes. For real-time collaboration, a dedicated sync service may be better.

**Which AI provider should I choose?**

- **GPT‚Äë5** for general use and balanced performance.
- **Claude** for complex reasoning.
- **Gemini** for very long contexts.
- **Ollama** for privacy and offline use.

**Can I use multiple AI providers?**  
Yes ‚Äî configure multiple and switch anytime.

**Is my data sent to AI providers?**  
Only when using cloud providers. Ollama keeps everything local.
