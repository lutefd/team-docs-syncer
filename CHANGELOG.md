- Nothing yet.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added

- Pinning system for files in chat sessions via `ChatSessionService.ts` (pin, unpin, getPinned methods).
- @mention support in chatbot composer for searching and pinning files, with dropdown menu.
- New AI tool `follow_links` in `AiTools.ts` to extract and follow internal Markdown links for better context gathering.
- Handling for file creations and proposals in `AiService.ts` and `ChatbotView.ts`, including `handleCreations` and `handleProposals` methods.
- Thinking state with animation in chatbot messages during AI processing.
- Fullscreen diff modal with toggle between rendered Markdown and raw text views in `DiffModal.ts`.
- Internal link fixing in rendered content for both chatbot messages and diff modal.
- Status updates during tool usage in streaming (e.g., "Searching documents...").
- Styles for pins, mention menu, thinking animation, and fullscreen diff modal in `styles.css`.

### Changed

- Bumped version to `1.3.0` in `manifest.json`, `package.json`, and `version.json`.
- Updated system prompts in `AiService.ts` and `ChatbotView.ts` to emphasize tool usage, link following, and pinned files.
- Refactored `streamChat` in `AiService.ts` to handle multi-step tool calls with `onStepFinish`, collect all tool results, and generate follow-up text summarizing actions without content.
- Removed non-streaming `chat` method from `AiService.ts`.
- Updated `propose_edit` and `create_doc` tools in `AiTools.ts` to require and return full content, with improved logging and error handling.
- Increased snippet sizes in `search_docs` and added try-catch to `read_doc`.
- Streamlined write mode in `ChatbotView.ts`: removed `EditTargetModal`, integrated edit generation via tools, handled proposals/creations directly.
- UI tweaks in `ChatbotView.ts`: reordered header elements, added composer input handling for mentions.
- Enhanced diff modal to be fullscreen with better rendering and link handling.

### Fixed

- Ensured proposals and creations are properly captured and applied even in multi-step tool chains.
- Fixed potential empty responses by always generating a follow-up summary.
- Improved reliability of file operations with folder creation and existence checks.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-12

### Changed

- Streamed AI response generation for file edits in write mode, displaying progress in the chat interface.
- Removed redundant path check in edit application (assumed handled upstream).
- Simplified success notice for applied edits.
- Updated error notice text for generate & apply failures.

### Fixed

- Ensured streamed edit responses are properly rendered as Markdown and handled empty responses via fallback.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-12

### Added

- AI integration with OpenAI for chatbot functionality, including chat and write modes.
- New services: `AiService` for handling AI interactions, `MarkdownIndexService` for indexing and searching Markdown files, `ChatSessionService` for managing chat sessions.
- New UI components: `ChatbotView` for the main chatbot interface, `ChatSessionsModal` for session management, `DiffModal` for reviewing changes, `EditTargetModal` for selecting edit targets.
- New tools in `AiTools.ts` for searching docs, reading docs, proposing edits, and creating docs.
- OpenAI settings: API key, model, temperature, and max tokens in `SettingsTab.ts`.
- Ribbon icon and command for opening the Team Docs Chatbot.
- Streaming support for AI responses in chatbot.
- Sources panel in chatbot to display referenced files.
- Proposal review and application for write mode edits, with reservation checks.
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for git commands in `GitService.ts` to handle transient failures.

### Changed

- Bumped version to `1.2.0` in `manifest.json`, `package.json`, and `version.json`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to include `dist` and `.DS_Store`.
- Enhanced file handling in `FileHandlers.ts` with additional reservation syncs before reverting changes.
- Registered chatbot view in `main.ts`.
- Improved command manager to include open chatbot command.
- Updated reservation manager with `git add -A` before commits and retries for push/fetch.
- Changed activity feed refresh interval to 30 seconds in `TeamActivityFeed.ts`.
- Extended UIManager with `openChatbot` method.
- Added dependencies: `@ai-sdk/openai`, `ai`, `zod` in `package.json`.
- Updated styles in `styles.css` for chatbot UI elements.

### Fixed

- Improved reliability of reservation syncing with retries in `EditReservationManager.ts`.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed

- Resolve TypeScript timer typing errors for `clearInterval(...)` by switching to `ReturnType<typeof setInterval>` in `main.ts` and `src/ui/TeamActivityFeed.ts`.

### Build

- Output artifacts to `dist/team-docs-syncer/` and copy `manifest.json` and `styles.css` via an esbuild plugin in `esbuild.config.mjs`.

### Chore

- Bump version map to `1.1.1` in `version.json`.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-09

### Added

- Offline editing support: reservation checks/enforcement only when the remote is reachable.
- `GitService.isRemoteReachable(timeoutMs?: number)` in `src/services/GitService.ts` to detect connectivity via a quick `git ls-remote`.

### Changed

- `FileHandler.onFileModified()` and `FileHandler.onEditorChange()` in `src/handlers/FileHandlers.ts`:
  - Online: preserve original behavior (sync/extend reservations, revert unauthorized edits, enforce read-only for othersâ€™ reservations).
  - Offline: skip reservation sync/enforcement and do not revert edits.

### Tests

- `tests/services/GitService.test.ts`: success/failure coverage for `isRemoteReachable()`.
- `tests/handlers/FileHandlers.test.ts`:
  - No read-only enforcement on editor change when offline.
  - No revert or reservation attempts on modify when offline.
- `tests/helpers/mockPlugin.ts`: adds `gitService.isRemoteReachable` mock.

### Notes

- Auto-commit still requires a valid local reservation; offline commits are skipped unless you already hold one.
- `.gitignore`: now ignores `coverage`.
